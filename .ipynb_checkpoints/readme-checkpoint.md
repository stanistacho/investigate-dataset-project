The analysis consists of following:

##### Research Part 2: What features are associated with popular genre?

## Conclusion
As the exploration analysis has certainly its limitations. I do not focus further on any predictions, the conclusions resulting from the analysed data are open ended and may possible vary if further and more advanced exploration is applied.

I may conclude that **better rating** received from movie fans, the **more popular** the movie **can be**. However I remind, that popularity index consists of more information than only number of votes/rating.  Vote is one of spectrum information and may say that it **may influence the other** information which are part of popularity index. However, such conclusion is not confirmed by the work and requires further analysis.

The conclusion of budget and revenue impact on movie popularity seems reasonable and based on expectations. I made certain simplifications and set budget/revenue levels in order to better capture huge amount of data. Movies with **high budget** (level, quantile 75% and more) were **most popular** and the same conclusion with revenue. **High revenue** (level, quantile 75% and more) earned was connected with movies with **higher popularity index**.
More resources for filming may be associated with more famous and favorite actors/actresses, higher quality, better promo campaign which may catch more movie fans. More and more movie fans positively influence revenue earned.

There is **no relationship** between **popularity** in terms of **better rating** received and runtime. It means that runtime of popular movie may take 10 minutes or 100 minutes, it is not the feature which movie fan takes into consideration when evaluating the movie.

**Popularity** increased over the period (1960 up to 2015) and the **trend has been increasing**. Such development is expected as it is inline with technological development and much easier access to movies.

From the analysis results that **the most popular genre over period is drama**, even the increase over the times is more than 90%. The popularity of drama may mean that this is the genre which earn most.
